You girls are doing a terrific job learning git!

I am putting together a file with both command line instructions and screenshots of where those options are in Android Studio. It is not yet complete but it has enough information to get started, it would also allow you to ask questions if anything in there is confusing.

This is my first time writing this type of instructions, so it's meant to be a draft that I can improve on as questions arrive.

The file, with its snapshots, is included with this Pull Request. Follow this link to review the instructions:
